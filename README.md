Descriptions of the app

Expats find it difficult to  understand local texting abbreviations in text messaging, and therefore are unable to effectively communicate. 
This web application translates local abbreviated text messages into a user's native language such that it bridges their communication.

Features:
- Takes input of any abbreviated texts in a language (Bahasa Indonesia)
- Translates abbreviated texts to their extended form and translates to target language, notably English
