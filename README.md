Descriptions of the app

Expats find it difficult to  understand local texting abbreviations in text messaging, and therefore are unable to effectively communicate. 
This web application translates local abbreviated text messages into a user's native language such that it bridges their communication.

Features:
- Takes input of any abbreviated texts in a language (Bahasa Indonesia)
- Translates abbreviated texts to their extended form and translates to target language, notably English

All Lofi and Hifi designs were developed in Sketch and Adobe XD.
The coded Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is developed using React, and styled with a CSS Framework Tailwind, as well as DaisyUI component library for rapid prototyping.
